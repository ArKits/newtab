NavaPages are personalized Newtab pages that aim to make you more productive by bringing what you need at your fingertips (and your newtabs). 
NPv4 is a newer NavaPage based on Bootstrap 4. It's barebones with organized links to sites and a mini-rss feed column.

###Credits

•	NPv4 also uses jQuery and Bootstrap 4(currently in alpha).
